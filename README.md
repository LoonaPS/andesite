# andesite
Definitions and tools used for LoonaPS made into a TypeScript/JavaScript module.

## Notice
### **What happened to Bazal?**
Well, we unified it into our tool named **andesite**. Bazal's GHA compartment will still be available, but will be renamed to Bazal; which will be our GitHub workflows for compiling interface definitions to TypeScript code.
